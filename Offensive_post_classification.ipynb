    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### 1. Domain-specific area \n",
    "\n",
    "In a world closely interconnected by social media, it is hard to avoid to avoid offensive or disturbing posts/comments online. With the growing usage of online platforms, designing algorithms to flag problematic posts becomes an increasingly important task. Many previous attempts to understand biased/implied harm in the statement are to treat it as a simple toxicity classification(toxic or non-toxic) (e.g. Waseem and\n",
    "Hovy, 2016). However, research indicates that simple hate detection has the risk of discriminating against minority groups. For example, Sap et al. (2019) show that using Perspective (a tool developed by Jigsaw/Alphabet for toxic language detection), the toxicity scores of the sentences in African American English (AAE) are higher than their non-AAE equivalents. Davidson et al. (2019) also show a similar observation that abusive language detection systems easily discriminate against social media posts written in AAE. In other words, the detection algorithms are likely to discriminate against groups who are often the target of those abusive languages that people are trying to detect. Both pieces of research also stress the importance that the identities of the annotators could create bias in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been shown that in the field of hate speech detection, simple toxic and non-toxic classifications are not sufficient. Therefore, the challenge is to create a classification algorithm that takes the high variation of demographics into account. With a better algorithm assessing  more than just toxic/non-toxic content on social media, users and moderators can have a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of the flagged post and select what type of toxic posts they are more concerned about. \n"

    "#### 2. Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "This project used Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) to address the challenge (Sap et al., 2020). The dataset was constructed by a research group led by Dr Maarten Sap at the University of Washington (http://tinyurl.com/social-bias-frames). The purpose of creating this dataset is to assess potential language biases more holistically by taking offensiveness, the speaker's intent, and why the implication is biased into account. The corpus contains 44k social media posts (unstructured text) with 150k structured annotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, a subset of the data is used to build a model that can predict whether a text is offensive and fits into one or more categories (body, culture, disabled, gender, race, social, victim).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources of SBIC are collected from various online platforms but can be broken down into three categories: Reddit, Twitter and hate sites. For Reddit and Twitter, the team annotated the posts from existing datasets collected for previous publications (Breitfeller et al., 2019; Davidson et al, 2017; Founta et al., 2018; Waseem and Hovy, 2016). The datasets include posts that contain potential microaggression, toxic, abusive, racist, or sexist language. In addition, posts from English hate communities were also included: Stormfront and Gab, which are undocumented white-supremacist and neo-Nazi forums, and two English banned subreddits. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Annotation design\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation task for the corpus was achieved through crowdsourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each post, annotators decided whether it is offensive, whether the intent was to offend, and whether it contains sexual content or references. The answer is categorical (yes, no, maybe) for these questions and then transformed into a numerical variable (between 0-1: 0 means no, 1 means yes) in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the annotators believed the post was offensive, they would answer the group implication question, i.e. if the post targets a specific category or demographic, workers then selected which one and write down two to four stereotypes per selected group (Sap et al., 2020).\n",
    "The demographic background of the annotators could affect the annotation. Hence, the SBIC dataset also includes relevant information (such as gender, political stands). Each post has annotations by three different people. On average, the annotations show 82.4% pairwise agreement (ibid.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data type and size\n",
    "\n",
    "SBIC consists of categorical variables and free-form text. The corpus is in CSV format and is already split into training, testing and developing files. Each line contains the post, the annotations (e.g. the intent of offensiveness, the sexual references or target groups), the demographic information (e.g. gender, age or race) of the annotators and the data source. The primary annotation used in this project is the target category which is a multi-label field. Each post can be labelled with one or more of the following categories but not every post has a labelled category\n",
    "\n",
    "There are are also aggregated versions of the corpus. As mentioned, each post in SBIC has three separate annotations. Hence, the aggregated version took an average of numerical fields and added up categorical fields. The code to aggregate the files is provided when downloading the dataset. \n",
    "There are both aggregated and non-aggregated versions for training, testing and developing files. The corpus is about 10MB for the aggregated version, while the non-aggregated version is 36MB. Aggregated version loses fine-grain information (e.g. demographic information of the annotators and if the speaker was part of the same minority group that's being targeted). However, for this project, the aggregated versions were used.\n"

    "#### 3. Objectives of the project \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build a multi-label classifier for detecting different target categories of offensive social media posts. This classification can potentially have two applications 1) commercial application: users and moderators can have more detailed information of why a post is flagged; 2) academic purpose: improve understanding the nature of different offensive texts. A multi-label classifier is chosen for this project instead of a multi-class classifier because in the corpus, some of the posts have more than one label. In multi-label classification, each sample can have more than one label, and the labels are not mutually exclusive. In multi-class classification, each sample only has one label. Multi-label classification is closer to real life scenario. For example, a Twitter post can be flagged with racial and gender discrimination. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the objective, SBIC is used to construct a multi-label classifier on social media posts whether the post contains text from one or more of seven categories seven offensive categories (body, culture, disabled, gender, race, social, victim). This means that a post can be labelled with multiple categories (e.g. race and gender) or no labels if it’s not offensive in one of these categories. A baseline is trained with one-vs-rest logistic regression using scikit-learn. Logistic regression is believed to be effective in machine learning for classification problems. The regularization in the algorithm is required to avoid over-fitting (Lee et al., 1999). The classifier is trained with BERT large model (cased) and PyTorch Lightning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Google, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a Transformer model that is pretrained on large un-labelled corpus in English (Wikipedia and Book Corpus). Masked language modelling allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence (Devlin et al, 2018). It means that BERT learns information from a series of tokenized words from both left to right but also right to left (ibid.). The architecture of BERT large model used in the project consists of 24 layers of encoder blocks, 16 attention heads and 340M parameters. \n"

    "#### 4. Evaluation methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation for multi-label classification is more challenging than multiclass classification. For example, accuracy score is commonly used for classification evaluation, but calculating accuracy for multi-label classification is a problem. Are we calculating exact matches? Or just a partial match? One indicator for evaluating the result is not sufficient for a multi-labelling problem. Hence, in this project, there are five different parameters used for evaluating the results for both the baseline model and BERT classifier: 1) accuracy, 2) hamming loss, 3) precision, 4) recall and 5) F1 score. \n",

    "- **Preprocessing (2): Text preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing procedure is different for the baseline model and the BERT classifier. Therefore, this section will only mention the preprocessing for the baseline model. The BERT classifier preprocessing will be discussed in Section 7: Classification approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset consists of social media posts, removing noise first, such as symbols and escapes characters, is important. Hence, the text preprocessing steps are: lowercase the text => remove special characters => tokenize the text => lemmatize the text => remove stop words. After the text is cleaned with the steps above, it is transformed into feature vectors with TfidfVectorizer.\n",
    "- Tokenization is an essential preprocessing step. It breaks down a text into smaller units/tokens, and those tokens can be directly transformed into different vector representations, which are suitable for machine learning. \n",
    "- Lemmatization is used here instead of stemming. Stemming attempts to reduce a word to its stem, but over-stemming is a common issue. For example, passing \"properties\" into Snowballstemmer in nltk returns \"properti\". Lemmatization is more rule-based complex stemming. It converts the word to its meaningful base form. When passing through “properties”, it will return “property”.\n",
    "- TF-IDF method is chosen because compared with another form of text representation (like bag of words), TF-IDF distinguishes very common words or rare words. TF-IDF considers not just the occurrence of a word in a single document but in the entire corpus.\n",

    "For handling multi-label classification, there are two ways: problem transformation methods and algorithm adaptation methods. Problem transformation methods treat multi-label problems as a set of binary classifications. Algorithm adaptation adapts the algorithms, which can directly apply to multi-label classification. For example, multi-label version of kNN is represented by MLkNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of the problem transformation methods, one-vs-rest logistic regression is chosen to build a baseline model. One-vs-rest method essentially transforms a multi-label problem into multiple single-label problems. With this strategy, multiple independent binary classifiers are built. Logistic regression is chosen here as an estimator instead of Naïve Bayes, widely used in text classification. It has been shown shown that the conventional Naïve Bayes classifier sees each label independently and neglects its relations (Kim et al., 2020). Hence, for multi-label classification, Naïve Bayes often results in degraded accuracy. Naïve Bayes classification was also experimented with in this project. The results align with the literature. \n"

    "#### 7. Classification approach: build a classifier with BERT and PyTorch Lightning \n",
    "Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture that only relies on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output (Devlin et al, 2018; Vaswani et al., 2017). As implied in its name (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), BERT uses Transformer encoder blocks. Each encoder block consists of two modules: a self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer (ibid.). After the input text goes through tokenization, it will first pass through a multi-headed attention layer and then a feed-forward layer. Multi-headed attention computes attention different times with different weight matrices and then concatenates the results, depending on how many attention heads are there. It allows the model to associate each word in the input to another. The feed forward layer makes each attention matrix into an acceptable form by the subsequent encoders. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different variation BERT models. Some handle different languages and some have different numbers of parameters. BERT large model is used in this project to build the classification model. The architecture of the BERT large model consists of 24 layers of encoder blocks, 16 attention heads and 340M parameters. BERT is a powerful NLP model with wide range of application. For example, it can be used for text summarization and question answering; Facebook also used RoBERTa (a variation of BERT) to detect harmful context (text classification task)(Kiela et al., 2020). BERT is chosen for this project. First, it is pretrained on a large corpus. Also, BERT learns information with no specific direction by taking into account the surrounding context. Hence, it does a better job at understanding the text than previous NLP methodologies. For example, previous language models such as word2vec and GloVe have limitations in interpreting context and polysemous words.\n"

[SEP] lets BERT understand which token belongs to which sentence. This token is more important in the next sentence prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing about the BERT model is that the maximum size of tokens it can take is 512. If the tokens in a sequence are less than 512, [PAD] token can be used to pad the unused token slots. Since the dataset is mainly social media posts in this project, the maximum size will not be an issue. "

    "#### 9. Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the BERT classifier shows a decent result considering the challenging task in multi-labelling. Accuracy is 77% with 4% hamming loss. It means about 4% of the all the predicted labels are incorrect. Overall, the evaluation shows high recall (micro average: 74%) and high precision (micro average: 83%). There is also a noticeable improvement compared with the baseline model. The overall accuracy increased from 66% to 77%, which is an absolute improvement of 11% and relative improvement by 18%. The hamming loss dropped from 5.5% to 4%, which is an absolute improvement of 1.7% and relative improvement of 30% (for hamming loss, the lower the better). \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the performance of individual classes, other than body, BERT classifier improves the recall of each category, with a slight drop in precision. BERT classifier also shows promising result in major categories (*race, gender and culture*). Interestingly, both BERT classifier and baseline model struggle to have good precision and recall on the *body* category. It is possible that there are less training samples for the body category. \n",

    "#### 10. Summary and conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "With BERT large model, this project successfully constructs a multi-label classifier on predicting offensive social media post and the classifier reaches almost 80% accuracy on the test set. Creating a \"fair\" offensive language detection model requires a well annotated dataset. The classifier built on SBIC can contribute to identifying offensive language and its target categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall results of the classifier are satisfying but the model predictions on minor target categories (*body, social and victim*) need improvement. Techniques such as random oversampling and undersampling could be considered in the future. The current method of preprocessing for BERT classifier (passing through raw text directly into classifier) seems to be effective. However, removing escape characters and numbers in the text might improve the accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current classifier is suitable for short social media posts. With modification, the classifier can potentially detect hate speech or content that people may find offensive before publishing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses BERT large model and PyTorch Lightning to build the classifier. A few alternative approaches can achieve the same goal: (1) There are other transformer pre-trained models that are more powerful than BERT, such as GPT2 and GPT Neo. Training the dataset on these models could yield better results, because they have more parameters. However, it will also require more training time or computing power. (2)  BERT can also be loaded through Tensorflow. PyTorch Lightning is more user friendly, and it is more intuitive to build models. However, Tensorflow is better supported with bigger communities.  \n",
