## Multilabel classification on offensive social media post with BERT and PyTorch Lightning
This project utilizes the Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) to develop a multi-label classifier capable of detecting offensive social media posts and categorizing them into one or more targeted categories. The model was constructed using BERT and PyTorch Lightning.

This notebook consists of three main sections:

- Introduction: This section outlines the domain-specific challenge, project objectives, dataset, and evaluation metrics used to assess the results.

- Implementation: This section details the data preprocessing, the baseline model's performance, and the classification approach.

- Conclusions: This section evaluates the classifier's outcomes, assesses the project's application and contribution, and explores alternative approaches.
