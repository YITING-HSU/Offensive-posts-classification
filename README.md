## Multilabel classification on offensive social media post with BERT and PyTorch Lightning
This project uses the Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) to construct a multi-label classifier to detect whether a social media post is offensive and fits into one or more targeted categories. BERT and PyTorch Lightning were used to build the model.

This notebook consists of three main sections:

- Introduction: The section describes the challenge in the domain-specific area, objectives of the project, the dataset and the evaluation metrics that were chosen to evaluate the results.

- Implementation: This section includes data preprocessing, performance of the baseline model and the classification approach.

- Conclusions: This section evaluates the results of the classifier, the application and contribution of the project, and different alternative approaches.
